# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

Vars

```shell
npx hardhat vars set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

```

```shell
npx hardhat vars set ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

```shell
npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```
